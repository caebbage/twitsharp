# twitsharp

Made by [cae](https://twitter.com/mmt_n_). Do whatever you want with it but credit is nice.

This inserts a semi-transparent picture in the corner of your picture so that Twitter won't turn it into a jpeg.

Multiple files supported, files automatically downloaded.

This doesn't use any servers so nobody will ever know what pictures you were using.

This also means if you save the webpage it should work without internet.
